# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: Joel is a deeply analytical, personable, and straightforward professional with demonstrated success managing and developing full life-cycle software products while understanding and exceeding customersâ€™ needs. He has over twenty years of experience in IT, with the majority of that time spent developing software for a variety of businesses. When he's not working full-time at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), he's either working on several development projects on the side for his own business as well as App vNext (founded by industry veteran, Carl Franklin), or playing with his 5 kids so they don't destroy the house (or each other).  Joel is enthusiastic about constantly learning new technologies, techniques, and tools in order to improve his skill set. He's always ready to geek out over shiny new gadgets, shiny new development frameworks, or reminisce about crusty old technology that haunts his past.
